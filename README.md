# Smart Queuing System: Choosing the Hardware for Edge AI

We've provided three different Smart Queuing System scenarios that depict real-world problems based on different sectors where edge devices are typically deployed.

The three scenarios you'll be looking at are:
* Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
* Scenario 2: Retail Sector
* Scenario 3: Transportation Sector

All of the scenarios involve people in queues, but each scenario will require different hardware depending on the requirements.

At a high level, you will:
* Propose a possible hardware solution
* Build out your application and test its performance on the Intel DevCloud using multiple hardware types
* Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
* Revise your hardware proposal based on the test results
